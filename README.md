# Work_Schedule_Manager

All (ImageProcesses, FileProcesses, EventProcesses) files have "helper" functions which get the job done with a couple lines of code.

In `run_main.py`, a workflow example can be seen. There are some commented lines since I discovered that the table the Costco employee site renders is an html table
which can be easily parsed using pandas rather than using image processing. Yet, I left the setup for using OpenCV and Tesseract on there ðŸ˜€

##### Notes

Due to py32win dependency, EventProcesses.py is fully operational on Windows with Outlook installed.
